# About Me {#about-me}

Hi! Iâ€™m Can Chen, a first-year PhD student in Data Science at the [HalÄ±cÄ±oÄŸlu Data Science Institute](https://datascience.ucsd.edu), [University of California San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu/). 

My previous research focused on online learning and optimization for machine learning applications. I am now interested in problems related to large language models (LLMs), particularly in alignment, controllable generation, and model safety.
