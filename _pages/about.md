# About Me

Hi! I’m Can Chen, a first-year PhD student in Data Science at the [Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute](https://datascience.ucsd.edu), [University of California San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu/). I’m fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jun-Kun Wang](https://jimwang123.github.io).

My research interest lies in online optimization and reinforcement learning. Recently, I am working on the LLM-generated text detection by online optimization.
